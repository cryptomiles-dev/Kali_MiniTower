
These are the guidelines used by the CIS.  The [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/white-papers/cis-password-policy-guide) is the Center For Internet Security.  

1. Use passphrases instead of passwords – Length is the most important aspect of a good password.
2. Don’t use words related to your personal information – Avoid things that attackers can look up about you on the Internet.
3. Limit using dictionary words – Use non-dictionary alternatives in your passphrases.

Furthermore, take advantage of the following options that you have today:

4. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA / 2FA)  – Present two, or more pieces of evidence when logging into an account.
5. Use password managers – Keep your passwords safe in a vault, without the need of remembering any of them.
6. Enable account lockout mechanisms – Enforce temporary accounts lockouts after several consecutive failed attempts, or use time doubling login throttling.

Lastly, there are 2 additional points that are worth keeping in mind (borrowed from the [Schneier on Security blog](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html)):

7. Never reuse a password you care about – Even if you choose a secure password, the site it’s for could leak it because of their own incompetence.
8. Beware of the “secret question” – You don’t want a backup system for when you forget your password to be easier to break than your password. Really, it’s smart to use a password manager.
