## Step 1: Update Your Package Index  

Before installing or searching for packages, update your systemâ€™s package index to ensure you have the latest information about available packages.

Run the following command in the terminal:

`sudo apt update`

If you also want to upgrade your existing packages, use:

`sudo apt upgrade`

## Step 2: Search for Packages  

To find a package, use the `apt search` command followed by the package name or a keyword.

### Example:

If you want to search for a package related to "Wireshark," type:

`apt search wireshark`

This will display a list of available packages with "wireshark" in their name or description.

## **Step 3: Get Details About a Package**

To see detailed information about a package, use:

`apt show <package-name>`

This will display details such as the package's description, dependencies, and size.

## **Step 4: Install a Package**

Once you know the package name, install it using:

`sudo apt install <package-name>`

When prompted, confirm the installation by typing `Y` and pressing Enter.

## **Step 5: Remove a Package (Optional)**

If you need to uninstall a package, use:

`sudo apt remove <package-name>`

If you want to remove configuration files as well, use:

`sudo apt purge <package-name>`

## Step 6: Clean Up Unused Packages (Optional)

After removing a package or upgrading your system, you can clean up unused packages to free up space:

To remove cached package files:

`sudo apt clean`
